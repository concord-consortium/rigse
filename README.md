CC Rails Portal Activity Authoring, Deployment, and Reporting System
====================================================================
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/concord-consortium/rigse.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/concord-consortium/rigse)

Setup
-----

### Prerequisites

Working git, ruby, and rubygems, wget

#### Core Extensions

-   [Extensions to core classes applied at application
    startup](docs/core-extensions.textile)

#### Simple Getting Started

##### Local development

This example assumes that [rvm](https://rvm.io/) is installed.
This could be a good idea because we use an older version of ruby. You should install Ruby 2.2.6 first:

    rvm install 2.2.6

If you use OS X and you see some errors related to SSL, you might need to use following command instead:
```
    rvm install 2.2.6 --with-openssl-dir=`brew --prefix openssl`
```


    git clone git@github.com:concord-consortium/rigse.git portal
    cd portal
    echo 'rvm --create use 2.2.6@portal' >.rvmrc
    rvm --create use 2.2.6@portal
    gem install bundler -v '1.11.0'
    bundle install
    cp config/database.sample.yml config/database.yml (need to fix the mysql password and/or user)
    cp config/settings.sample.yml config/settings.yml
    cp config/app_environment_variables.sample.rb config/app_environment_variables.rb
    rake db:setup
    rails s

Now open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

##### Using Docker

Install Docker and make sure that docker-compose is installed too (it should be part of the standard Docker installation).

    git clone git@github.com:concord-consortium/rigse.git portal
    cd portal
    docker-compose up # this will take 15 minutes to download gems

Increase memory available to Docker to 4GiB-5GiB (OSX: Preferences... -> Advanced tab).

Now open your browser to [http://0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000). On OS X this might
take more than 5 minutes to load the first page. Look in the terminal where you ran
`docker-compose up` to monitor progress.

Visit [the Docker docs](docs/docker.md) for how to use your portal running in docker. This
also includes: instructions on speeding things up on OS X, using a local dns+proxy system
to avoid port conflicts, and setting up ssh for capistrano deploys.

#### Setup Issues

If you get the following error

    An error occurred while installing libv8 (3.16.14.17), and Bundler cannot
    continue.
    Make sure that `gem install libv8 -v '3.16.14.17'` succeeds before bundling.

 To resolve the error install libv8 sepratelly with --with-system-v8

	gem install libv8 -v '3.16.14.17' -- --with-system-v8

If you get the following error

	An error occurred while installing therubyracer (0.12.1), and Bundler cannot
	continue.
	Make sure that `gem install therubyracer -v '0.12.1'` succeeds before bundling.

Replace `gem 'therubyracer',         "~>0.12.1"` entry in the Gemfile to `gem 'therubyracer',         "~>0.10.2"`

If `rails s -p 9000` fails due to mysql2 segmentation fault

    gems/mysql2-0.3.21/lib/mysql2/mysql2.bundle: [BUG] Segmentation fault

It usually helps to remove mysql2 and install it again

    gem uninstall mysql2
    bundle install

#### Tests

After getting the server running it's good to confirm that all the tests
pass before changing any code.

Prepare a database for use when running the spec tests:

    rake db:test:prepare

Start SOLR in test environment (it works with cucumber tests too):

    RAILS_ENV=test rake sunspot:solr:run

Run the rspec unit tests:

    rspec spec/

Prepare a database for use when running the cucumber tests:

    RAILS_ENV=cucumber rake db:create
    RAILS_ENV=cucumber rake db:schema:load
    rake db:test:prepare_cucumber

Run the cucumber integration tests:

    cucumber features/

All these tests should pass. If you add features make sure and add tests
for these new features.

#### SSO Clients and LARA (authoring) integration

If you want to provide authentication services to LARA, you need to:

1. Create a new SSO Client using `rake sso:add_client`
2. Add the client id and secret to LARA, by editing `config/app_environment_variables.rb`

### Theme support & Rolling your own theme:

We are using the
[themes_for_rails](https://github.com/lucasefe/themes_for_rails) gem
Theme views go in app/themes/(name)/views/
Theme assets go in app/assets/theme/(name)/
Sample config files go in config/themes/(name)/settings.sample.yml

For now the best thing to do is to copy an existing theme. eg:

    mkdir ./config/themes/<new_theme_name>

    # configuration files:
    cp ./config/themes/<old_theme_name>/settings.sample.yml
    ./config/themes/<new_theme_name>

    # view files:
    cp -r ./themes/<old_theme_name> ./themes/<new_theme_name>

    # assets:
    cp -r ./app/assets/themes/<old_theme_name>
    ./app/assets/themes/<new_theme_name>

    # finally change the theme setting in your config/settings.yml
    open config/settings.yml

## NCES District and School Tables

When a rails-portal instance is created two tables containing data for
schools and districts in the US are created from data supplied by the
[National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)](http://nces.ed.gov/).

NCES maintains a database about US districts and schools called the
[Common Core of Data](http://nces.ed.gov/ccd)

The rake task:
`portal:setup:create_districts_and_schools_from_nces_data`
downloads 2006 NCES CCD data files from NCES website and imports data
from these data files into the following models:

* `Portal::Nces06District`
* `Portal::Nces06School`

Only data from states and provinces identified in the
`config/settings.yml` for the portal instance are imported.

The NCES district and school models are used to provide data from which
districts and schools actively using the portal are be created.

The `Portal::Nces06District` includes about 50 different fields of data
for each district.

The `Portal::Nces06School`includes about 500 different fields of data
for each school.

## Testing

### Testing Frameworks

#### Rspec, Rspec-rails

* [rspec and rspec-rails](http://rspec.info/)
 * [rspec repo](http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec)
 * [rspec-rails repo](http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-rails)

#### Cucumber / Capybara

Feature specs that require javascript are run by Chrome via Selenium. By default Chrome will run in headless mode and there is nothing special you need to do inside of a Docker development environment.

However, if you would like to run Chrome in **non-headless mode** on your host machine, this is possible by making the following changes:

* set the environment variable `HEADLESS=false` if you are running the tests by using `docker-compose app exec /bin/bash`, then you can set HEADLESS in the shell.
* expose the capybara port by adding the docker-compose-publish-capybara-port overlay to to your .env file
* install `chromedriver` on your host machine
* start it with the command: `chromedriver --whitelisted-ips`
* ensure you have no firewall running on your host machine, or if you do please open port `9515`
* ensure that Chrome is installed on the host machine.

#### Factory Bot

> factory_bot allows you to quickly define prototypes for each of
your models and ask for instances with properties that are important to
the test at hand.

* [Factory Botrdoc](http://rdoc.info/projects/thoughtbot/factory_bot)

### Running the rspec tests

**Running all the rspec tests:*

    bundle exec rake spec

**Running a single file:**

    bundle exec rake spec SPEC=spec/routing/dataservice/bundle_contents_routing_spec.rb

**Running a single directory:**

    bundle exec rake spec SPEC=spec/routing/dataservice

**Running all the controller tests:**

    bundle exec rake spec SPEC=spec/controllers

### Running the feature tests with cucumber

**Running all the feature tests:**
    bundle exec rake cucumber

**Running all the feature tests using the ci_reporter gem that's used
on the hudson CI system:**
    bundle exec rake hudson:cucumber

**Running a single feature:**

    bundle exec cucumber features/student_can_not_see_deactivated_offerings.feature

**Running a single feature in non-headless mode:**

    HEADLESS=false bundle exec cucumber features/student_can_not_see_deactivated_offerings.feature

### Using binding.pry with Cucumber tests

##### Problem:
Integration tests are difficult to debug without accessing the content in the browser and inspecting the relevant elements. Using debugging tools in the command line or trying to view the problem from a screenshot is not helpful when the problem might be a hidden link or different element type, for example.

##### Solution:
Using `pry` in non-headless mode in Chrome opens a new Chrome window showing you the state of the page where `pry` has paused the test. You can inspect elements in the page at that point in time to more easily identify the problem.

##### How to use:
Follow the instructions above to set up and start chromedriver.

For a particular cucumber test where JavaScript is enabled, find the step you want to test:

    And I follow "Admin"

Find the corresponding step definition and insert `binding.pry`:

    When /^(?:|I )follow "([^"]*)"$/ do |link|    
      binding.pry    
      first(:link, link).click    
    end

Make sure chromedriver is running and run the test with HEADLESS=false prepended to the path

    $ HEADLESS=false bundle exec cucumber features/admin_accesses_special_pages.feature

When `pry` is hit, a new Chrome window will pop up where you can inspect element and use the pry in the command line as usual.


*note: Please see documentation regarding running `chromedriver` on your host machine above ☝️.*

## Capistano Tasks:

- [Capistrano Deployment Recipes](docs/cap-tasks.md)


## Updating a staging server.

Once a development branch has been deployed to a development server,
tested
and found reliable enough to deploy to staging here's how to do it.

Our convention is to create dev, staging, and production branches in the
git repository following that use the same name.

For example the *xproject* family have the following capistrano stages
and branches in teh git repository:

* *xproject_dev*_
* *xproject_staging*_
* *xproject_production*_

In the code below *<stage>* I will assume that we are using the
*xproject* series of stages and branches.

If you don't already have a local branch of staging

    git branch  --track xproject_staging origin/xproject_staging


Switch to the staging branch and merge from xproject_dev

    git co xproject_staging
    git merge xproject_dev


Push your copy of the staging branch to the gihub repository:

    git push origin xproject_staging

Dump the production database to this file `db/production_data.sql` on
the production server,
download it to the local folder `db/production_data.sql`, the cleans up
the production db/ folder.

    cap xproject_production db:fetch_remote_db

Push the production database from the local `db/production_data.sql` to
the staging server, then import the data into the database on staging, then cleanup.

    cap xproject_staging db:push_remote_db

Run any migrations on the staging server:

    cap xproject_staging deploy:migrate

There may be rake tasks that need to be run to update or fix data in the
database.

These should have corresponding capistrano tasks.

Test the staging server:
[http://xproject.staging.concord.org/](http://xproject.staging.concord.org/)

If the authors confirm that there are no blockers then let people know
when the update will take place and perform these tasks on the production server.

## other Rake tasks:

* `rigse:make:investigations` This task simply finds all activities with no parent investigation, and
creates a new investigation for that activity. The created investigation
has the same name and description as the activity it contains.

# haml

We use haml for some templates, see:
[http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com](http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com)/

To install this plugin we followed this procedure:

1. `gem install --no-ri haml`
1. `haml --rails path/to/rigse_app`


## Rendering

### haml

We use haml for some templates, see:
[http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com](http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com)/

to install this plugin we followed this procedure:
1. `gem install --no-ri haml`
1. `haml --rails path/to/rigse_app`


## Installers

Building installers requires that you are running on a mac with a local
installation of [Bit Rock](http://bitrock.com/)
The rake tasks assume that bitrock is in the standard /Applications/
folder.
You can override this by setting an environment variable in your shell
which points to the correct path, eg:
`export BITROCK_INSTALLER=/path/to/bitrock.app`

### config/installer.yml

Every host should have its own config/installer.yml file. There is a
config/installer.sample.yml file which can help get you started.
The shortname field should be specific to that host. Because of
limitations in bitrock, the shortname can not use
spaces,dashes,underscore, &etc.
The jnlp_url should point to a jnlp url on the target host. When you
run the
`rake build:installer:build_all` or
`cap installer:create` tasks, the jnlp_url must be available.


### Installer Rake Tasks:

Most of the installer building happens via rake tasks defined in
lib/tasks/make_installers.rake. a complete list of tasks can
be gotten using: `rake -T installer`

Here are the two useful tasks:

    rake build:installer:build_all # build all installers
    rake build:installer:new_release # create a new release specification interactively

Assuming that your installer.yml file is correct, running
`rake build:installer:build_all` will take care of the rest.
Build_all will automatically clean up, recache jars, and bump version
numbers.

### Installer Capistrano Recipes

There are two cap recipes in config/deploy.rb which take care of
creating installers using remote hosts installer.yml files.
* `cap installer:copy_config` copies the local installer.yml to the
remote server. This would be useful if you ran new_release locally, and
then
wanted to copy those config settings to the remote server.
* `cap installer:create` creates the installers and updates the remote
installer.yml file, and deploys the installer images.


### Sample session for building installers:

#### boot strapping an unconfigured server:

In this session we are assuming that we are working with a host which
does not have a local installer.yml file.
First we create a new local release. The first rake tasks asks a bunch
of questions, which are answered from the point of view of the staging
server.

     rake build:installer:new_release
     cap staging installer:copy_config
     cap staging installer:create


After running `rake build:installer:new_release`we end up with the
following local installer file:

    shortname: RitesStaging
    version: "200912.00"
    jnlp_config: [http://rites-investigations.staging.concord.org/investigations/545.jnlp](http://rites-investigations.staging.concord.org/investigations/545.jnlp)


this file gets pushed up to staging. with
`cap staging installer:copy_config` we only have to do that the first
time we create an
installer on staging. We could just as easily edit config/installer.yml.

The `cap staging installer:create` handles incrementing the version
number, and pushing the new config files and installers onto staging.

#### creating a fresh installer for a host that has had installers
before:

    cap staging installer:create

not much to do.

## Authentication, Sessions, and Cookies

### User authentication with Devise

Devise is already setup. The routes are setup, along with the mailers
and observers.
Forgotten password comes setup, so you don't have to mess around setting
it up with every project.

Devise uses the *pepper* parameter within settings.yml to encrypt user
passwords. A default *pepper* is provided in settings.samles.yml
You need to change this when deploying to a public server.

Devise is also setup to use user activation. Users which require
activation are sent emails
automatically.

### Single Sign On

The app supports user registration and authentication via third party single sign using OAuth. Using this feature requires setting up OAuth credentials with the third party.

The app currently supports OAuth registration and authentication using Google and Schoology.

To set up single sign on with Google, follow the steps below.

1) Create a new Google app in console.developers.google.com.

2) Create a set of OAuth credentials for the app. For the "Authorized JS origin" value use the valid public domain that resolves to your copy of the app on the web. For the "Authorized redirect URI" value use `https://[your domain]/users/auth/google/callback`.

3) Take the Client ID and Client Secret values created in step two and add them as values for GOOGLE_CLIENT_KEY (Client ID) and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET (Client Secret) in your app's .env file.

4) Restart the app.

#### Testing Single Sign On with Google and a Local Portal

Create a set of OAuth credentials for the app following the steps above, but for the "Authorized JS origin" value use a valid public top level domain that resolves to 127.0.0.1. Google won't accept 127.0.0.1 or a domain like app.portaldocker.local. An easy option is to use `https://lvh.me` which resolves to 127.0.0.1 without requiring any special configuration of your computer.

For the "Authorized redirect URI" value use `https://[your domain]:[your port number]/users/auth/google/callback`. If, for example, you use lvh.me and Docker is serving your portal over port 32789, the value would be `https://lvh.me:32789/users/auth/google/callback`.

## Uses the Database for Sessions

### Will Paginate

We use will_paginate in pretty much every project we use.

### Exception Notifier

You don't want your applications to crash and burn so Exception Notifier
is already installed to let
you know when everything goes to shit.

config/initializers/exception_notifier.rb does the setup. Currently it
reads
"admin_email" from config/settings.yml and use it as the destination
address.
The setup can be modified to include multiple email addresses.
See the homepage readme of exception notifier.

#### Bug

It seems rails 2.3.3 and 2.3.4 fails to deliver emails when someone
passes
multiple destination addresses as an array, which exception notifier
does.
config/initializers/fix_mailer_on_rails_2.3.4.rb fixes the problem.

The code is borrowed from [Dmitry
Polushkin](https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/2340-action-mailer-cant-deliver-mail-via-smtp-on-ruby-191)

## Databases

On OS X the mysql2 gem usually can't find the mysql client library that
it needs to run. The command below fixes that. It assumes your mysql is
installed in the default basedir of /usr/local/mysql/lib. And it assumes
you are using bundler.


    install_name_tool -change libmysqlclient.16.dylib /usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.16.dylib \
      `bundle show mysql2`/lib/mysql2/mysql2.bundle

For newer versions of rvm and mysql2, you will see an error like this

    dlopen(/Users/scytacki/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p545/extensions/x86_64-darwin-13/\
      1.9.1/mysql2-0.3.15/mysql2/mysql2.bundle, 9): Library not loaded: libmysqlclient.18.dylib
      Referenced from: /Users/scytacki/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p545/extensions/x86_64-darwin-13/\
        1.9.1/mysql2-0.3.15/mysql2/mysql2.bundle
      Reason: image not found - /Users/scytacki/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p545/extensions/x86_64-darwin-13/\
        1.9.1/mysql2-0.3.15/mysql2/mysql2.bundle

So then to fix a command like this is needed:

    install_name_tool -change libmysqlclient.18.dylib /usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.18.dylib \
      /Users/scytacki/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p545/extensions/x86_64-darwin-13/1.9.1/mysql2-0.3.15/mysql2/mysql2.bundle

## CSS

### Rails 3 Asset Pipeline

The portal uses the"Rails 3 Asset
Pipeline":[http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html)
stylesheets, images, javascript should all be placed in the app/assets/
directory structure.
theme specific assets should be placed in `app/assets/theme/themename/`.

You should read the Rails guide for more information about the asset
Pipeline.

themes_for_rails has been configured to play nice with the asset
pipeline. See the initializer:
`config/initializers/themes_for_rails.rb`

`cap deploy` should trigger the rake task assets:precompile to run.

You can also run locally by hand: `bundle exec rake assets:precompile`

The assets will be compiled to public/assets which should be ignored by
.gitignore

When running in development mode you do not need to pre-compile your
assets.

## Solr & Sunspot

[Sunspot](https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot/blob/master/README.md
) is being used to provide search capabilities.


You will need to create solr cores if you want to update materials or publish.
At the least you will need a 'development' solr core.  Here is a basic set of directions:

1. Make sure there are no solr processes running with `ps auxxwww | grep solr`
2. `scp -r deploy@learn.staging.concord.org:/web/portal/shared/solr-template solr`
3. `cp -r ./solr/production ./solr/development`
4. `vim ./solr/development/core.properties` (change name from production to development)
5. `bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start`
6. `bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:reindex` (edited)

You could also create a test core by repeating steps 3 & 4.

In development mode you will need to create an index and start sunspot:

    bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start
    bundle exec rake sunspot:reindex

You can then visit the web interface to the solar server by visiting [localhost:8982/solr/admin/](http://localhost:8982/solr/admin/). Though I haven't found any good reason to do so.

### Rspec testing with sunspot disabled & enabled:

For rspec tests see the helper methods defined in spec/support/solr_spec_helper.rb

For cucumber tests, you can use "Given The materials have been indexed" to update solr indexes after fixture data has been loaded.


[https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot/wiki/RSpec-and-Sunspot](https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot/wiki/RSpec-and-Sunspot)

### Solr delpoyment and index-updating ###

If you make changes to how Solr does its indexing, you will have to run a cap task to tell it to reindex:

In theory a simple `bundle exec cap <host> solr:reindex` should work, but
to be sure use: `bundle exec cap <host> solr:hard_reindex` to restart and reindex.

## Application Settings & Settings YAML

There is a settings.yml file that contains site-wide stuff. The site
name, url and admin email are all used
in the Devise mailers, so you don't need to worry about editing them.

### Database YAML

## Enabling features via environment variables

Certain features of the portal are controlled via environment variables.

The `PORTAL_FEATURES` environment variable can take a string of the form "feature1 feature2" to
include the following features:

* `geniverse_remote_auth`: Remote authentication
* `allow_cors`: Allow CORS requests (see below)
* `genigames_data`: Genigames-related student sata saving
* `geniverse_wordpress`: Geniverse-related Wordpress connection

If CORS is enable, by default it will allow any request from '*.concord.org', to any route, but can
be controlled by two additional environment variables:

* `CORS_ORIGINS="x.example.com y.z.example.org"`: Sets the allowed CORS origins to a specific whitelist
* `CORS_RESOURCES="/xyz"`: Sets the allowed CORS resources to a specific route


## Technical debt.

Here is a brief list of things which need to be looked into:

* the embeddables should be dryed up with some mixin / super class.
* not all embeddables are using send_update_events, which is causing
stale pages.
* ocassionally browser rendering gets wonky and raw html and or
javascript get displayed in the page.
* transition to unobtrusive JS.
* send_update_events *might* not do what we want it to do, tests
should be written for it.


## Misc

* password and password_confirmation are set up to be filtered
* there is a default application layout file
* a page title helper has been added
* index.html is already deleted
* rails.png is already deleted
* a few changes have been made to the default views

## Archiving a portal

A set of rake tasks is available under the ```archive_portal``` namespace that enable the portal data to be archived.  These tasks are:

* archive_portal:extract_and_upload_images - extracts the image binary data from the database and uploads it to S3
* archive_portal:generate_teacher_reports - generates learner details reports for all teachers and uploads them to S3
* archive_portal:generate_runnable_reports - generates learner details reports for all runnables and uploads them to S3

The rake tasks use a config file at /config/archive_portal.yml to specify the S3 bucket parameters to use when extracting images and to use when generating the url to those images in the reports.
A /config/archive_portal.sample.yml file exists to be copied and updated with real values.

These tasks will take a long time. Easiest way to run them is to ssh to running server and run them in the background
using nohup, e.g.:

`nohup bundle exec rake archive_portal:extract_and_upload_images &`

You can close your ssh session and the task will be still running. Logs will be saved in `nohup.out`.
