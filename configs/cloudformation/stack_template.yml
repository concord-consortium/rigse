  # Notes from 2017-11-14:
  # Based on usage over 4 weeks there are multiple spikes up to 1500 CPU units
  # Changing this value requires consideration of both the cluster autoscaler and
  # the service autoscaler. The cluster is autoscaled based on CPU reservation
  # so a larger value here will cause more EC2 instances to be added to the cluster
  # The service autoscaler is based on the percentage of CPU used out of this reserved
  # amount. So to keep the same kind of service scaling pattern the service autoscaler
  # is adjusted when this number is changed.
  # The learn portal was often bumping into the reserved memory amount of 1200mb.
  # Memory is increased to 1400mb.  This is necessary because the cluster is scaled by CPU
  # reservation only so if the Memory reservation is too high then the cluster won't
  # be scaled and new service won't fit in the cluster
  #
  # Notes from 2019-04-03:
  # The cluster has been changed to use the M series of EC2 instances so we have much
  # more memory to play with. Also on average over many weeks the average portal app
  # CPU Utilization is only getting up to 18%. I've learned that it is fine for tasks to
  # spike well above their Cpu requirement. So I think it is better to adjust their Cpu
  # requirement to be pretty close to their average. This helps cluster scale correctly.
  # So I'm going set the Cpu requirment 384 this should bump the average usage up to 48%.
  # We could probably lower this further, but I'd like to be conservative with the
  # adjustments. I'm going to leave the memory the same.
  #
  # Notes from 2020-12-09:
  # With the Cpu of 384, and the Cpu scaling alarm of 93, the app service was not scaling
  # soon enough. The p95 response time was getting up to 3 seconds and the number of tasks
  # was not scaling. I'm trying reducing the Cpu to 256 and the Cpu scaling alarm to 90.
  # This should trigger a scale event much sooner and hopefully keep the overall response
  # time down. The maximum number of app tasks (set as a parameter) is also increased to
  # 20.

  # Notes from 2019-04-03:

  # The CPU reservation of the app service was adjusted from 384 to 256. The app was not
  # scaling soon enough, with this CPU decrease the average CPU metric will be 1.5 times

  # Most of the time the report task is just sitting around. So it doesn't need to
  # reserve a lot of Cpu. A much better approach would be look again at the parts of the

  # task. But in the meantime we an set the Cpu low, and just let it spike up to use as
  # much of the available CPU as it can, when someone decides to use it.

  # Notes from Nov 14, 2017
  # Reviewing data over 4 weeks of usage
  # several CPU spikes up to 768 CPU and one spike up to 1024.
  # Since we are running on CPU rich Servers it is safe to reserve as much as the spikes
  # the workers never used more than 270mb of memory. That number is an average of the
  # workers in each service. So individual workers might have spiked higher.
  # This number of 600 provides quite a lot of padding
  #
  # Notes from March 21, 2019
  # looking at 3 months of usage with a worker/task of 1, cpu:1024, memory:600
  # CPU maxing out at 65% with some spikes during deploment (it seems)
  # Memory maxing out at 50%
  # I'm trying two changes to use resources better and trigger more autoscaling:
  # Cpu: 512, Memory: 384
  # what we really need for autoscaling though is a queue depth metric so we can get a
  # rough sense of how far behind we are getting on our queue
  #
  # Notes from March 26, 2019
  # The worker was running around 60% CPU usage under load. Then when a few more tasks
  # came in, the processing time increased probably because of a delayed queue. So I'm
  # decreasing the Cpu limit to 384 this will cause the percent usage to be  80% which
  # will trigger an autoscale event
  # note: this change was not deployed until March 28
