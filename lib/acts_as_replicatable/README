ActsAsReplicatable
==================

Specify this act if you want to be able to replicate models from one instance of this web application to another.
But ... so far all this plugin does is create and save a uuid for model instances.

Example
=======

You need to add a uuid attribute (string, limit=36) to the models you use this plugin with.

  t.column :uuid, :string, :limit => 36

Then in the model definition add:

  acts_as_replicatable
