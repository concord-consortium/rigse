# === Module SearchableModel
#
# An extension of code described here:
#
#   http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/wikis/simple-search
#
# Extend a model class with SearchableModel to support paginated searching
#
#    self.extend SearchableModel
#
# Specify attributes to be searched in a class variable and accessor called:
#
#    @@searchable_attributes = %w{name description model_type.name}
#    class <<self
#      def searchable_attributes
#        @@searchable_attributes
#      end
#    end
# 
# Create @searchable_attributes instance variable in controller for model
# for later use in view.
#
#   @searchable_attributes = Investigation.searchable_attributes
#
# Create controller paginated model instance variable like this:
# 
#    @investigations = Investigation.search(params[:search], params[:page], current_visitor)
#
# Optionally add an include parameter to eagerly load asociations:
#
#   @investigations = Investigation.search(params[:search], params[:page], current_visitor, [{:learners => :learner_sessions}])

    # FIXME - This search should do the following: split the terms based on whitespace, then perform the search
    # like this.  Given fields a, b, and c, and terms x and y we want to query in this way:
    # (a like x OR b like x OR c like x) AND (a like y OR b like y OR c like y)
    # we should also allow the search not to break on whitespace enclosed in quotes... maybe tokenize it?
    # iterate over the string, look for quote or just start the strings into an array
    # we could first split then check each part and see if it has a quote or not.  If one has a quote, it needs to be combined with the subsequent one until the other quote is found
    # do a search to see if we have quoted strings, and then replace the whitespace in the quoted strings with another character, then do the split, then fix the whitespace
    # or just only allow quotes at start and end
    # maybe we'll need to add a nested block.
