          <p><strong>Welcome! We're so glad you created a teacher account on our STEM Resource Finder!</strong> It's time to add a class and assign activities to your students.</p>

          <p>To create a new class, follow these steps:</p>
          <ul className={css.numberedStepsList}>
            <li><span className={css.stepNumber}>1</span> Click <strong>Add Class</strong> at the bottom of the menu on the left.</li>
            <li><span className={css.stepNumber}>2</span> Name your class.</li>
            <li><span className={css.stepNumber}>3</span> Optionally, give the class a short Description.</li>
            <li><span className={css.stepNumber}>4</span> Create a class word. The class word is a unique access code that allows students to join the class. <br />
              Our system is designed to prevent the occurrence of identical class words. Class words can be more than one word. They are not case sensitive. Do not include any special characters (e.g., *&@%!).
            </li>
            <li><span className={css.stepNumber}>5</span> Remember to write down your class word. Your students will use it to register themselves.</li>
            <li><span className={css.stepNumber}>6</span> Select the appropriate Grade Level(s) for your class.</li>
            <li><span className={css.stepNumber}>7</span> Click Save Changes.</li>
          </ul>

          </ul>
