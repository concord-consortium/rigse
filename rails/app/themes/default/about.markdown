### Default

Author: *Me*

This description can be found in themes/default/about.markdown:

The Default theme probably shouldn't exist.  Its confusing because by default the
theme system looks in the usual rails directory for views. So by default, the app/views
directory will be used.

In our case the files in app/views were created with RITES.  In the future we should move
RITES into its own themed directory...

Just some ideas.
