# Don't startup observers if we are building the app for the first time because the
# tables haven't been created yet. The classes being observed will throw 
# errors accessing the models when running db:migrate from scratch
#
# This is one way to test to see if we got here running rake db:migrate:
#
#   unless ( File.basename($0) == "rake" && ARGV.include?("db:migrate") ) 
# 
# but it won't help when running a task like this the first time:
#
#   rake rigse:setup:new_app

#
# So I'm using this method to find out if the standard "ActiveRecord::Base" 
# connection in the connection_pool is working:
#
#   ActiveRecord::Base.connection_handler.connection_pools["ActiveRecord::Base"].connected?
#  
# ### Nov 17 NP: This technique wasn't working, so, I placed the initializer code BACK into
# config/environment.rb in an config.after_initialize block...
#
#
# if ActiveRecord::Base.connection_handler.connection_pools["ActiveRecord::Base"].connected?
# # begin
#   ActiveRecord::Base.observers = :user_observer
#   ActiveRecord::Base.instantiate_observers
#   puts "Started observers"
# # rescue
# else
#   # intersetingly Rails::logger doesn't seem to be working here, so I am using ugly puts for now:
#   puts "Couldn't start observers #{$!}"
#   puts "This might be because you have not setup the appropriate database tables yet... "
#   puts "see config/initializers/observers.rb for more information."
# end
