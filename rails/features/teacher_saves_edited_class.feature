  As a teacher
  I want to edit my classes

  Background:

    And the database has been seeded
    And the classes "Mathematics" are in a school named "VJTI"
    And I am logged in with the username teacher
    And I am on "the class edit page for "Mathematics""

  Scenario: Teacher can see all the teachers which are in the class
    Then I should see "Taylor, P. (peterson)"
    And I should see "Nash, J. (teacher)"
