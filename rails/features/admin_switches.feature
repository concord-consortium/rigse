Feature: Admin switches to a different user

  In order to see the portal as other users do without knowing their passwords
  As an admin
  I want to switch to a different user

  Background:
    Given The default settings and jnlp resources exist using factories
    And the database has been seeded

  @javascript
  Scenario: Admin switches to student
    And I am logged in with the username admin
    And I switch to "Joe Switchuser" in the user list by searching "Switchuser"
    Then I should see "Welcome,"
    And I should see "Joe Switchuser"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Admin switches back to admin
    And I am logged in with the username admin
    And I switch to "Joe Switchuser" in the user list by searching "Switchuser"
    Then I should see "Welcome,"
    And I should see "Joe Switchuser"
    And I follow "Switch back"
    Then I should see "joe user"
