Feature: Teacher filters instructional materials

  As Teacher
  In order to find materials
  I need to search for them by subject and grade

  Background:
    Given the database has been seeded
    And I am logged in with the username admin

  @javascript @search
  Scenario: Searching Tagged materials
    Given the following Admin::tag records exist:
      | scope         | tag       |
      | grade_levels  | 5         |
      | grade_levels  | 7         |
      | subject_areas | Math      |
      | subject_areas | Science   |
      | model_types   | mt_Video  |

    # Create a first grade math activity:
    And I am on the new material page
    Then I should see "(new) /eresources"
    When I fill in "external_activity[name]" with "My grade 5 Math Activity"
    And I check "external_activity[is_official]"
    And I select "published" from "external_activity[publication_status]"
    And under "Grade Levels" I check "5"
    And under "Subject Areas" I check "Math"
    And I press "Save"

    # Create a 7th grade Science Activity
    And I am on the new material page
    Then I should see "(new) /eresources"
    When I fill in "external_activity[name]" with "My grade 7 Science Activity"
    And I check "external_activity[is_official]"
    And I select "published" from "external_activity[publication_status]"
    And under "Grade Levels" I check "7"
    And under "Subject Areas" I check "Science"
    And I press "Save"

    Given I am on the search instructional materials page
    And I uncheck "Sequence"
    And I check "Math"
    And I wait for the search to be ready
    Then I should see "My grade 5 Math Activity"
    And  I should not see "My grade 7 Science Activity"

    When I check "Science"
    And I uncheck "Math"
    And I wait for the search to be ready

    Then I should see "My grade 7 Science Activity"
    And I should not see "My grade 5 Math Activity"

    When I uncheck "Math"
    And I uncheck "Science"
    And I check "grade_level_7-8"
    And I wait for the search to be ready

    Then I should not see "My grade 5 Math Activity"
    And I should see "My grade 7 Science Activity"

    When I uncheck "grade_level_7-8"
    And I check "grade_level_5-6"
    And I wait for the search to be ready

    Then I should see "My grade 5 Math Activity"
    And I should not see "My grade 7 Science Activity"

  Scenario: Searching Materials tagged with Sensors
    Given the following Admin::tag records exist:
      | scope         | tag         |
      | sensors       | Temperature |
      | sensors       | Force       |
      | sensors       | Motion      |

    # Create a temperature sensor activity:
    And I am on the new material page
    Then I should see "(new) /eresources"
    When I fill in "external_activity[name]" with "My Temperature Sensor Activity"
    And I check "external_activity[is_official]"
    And I select "published" from "external_activity[publication_status]"
    And under "Sensors" I check "Temperature"
    And I press "Save"

    # Create a force sensor activity:
    And I am on the new material page
    Then I should see "(new) /eresources"
    When I fill in "external_activity[name]" with "My Force Sensor Activity"
    And I check "external_activity[is_official]"
    And I select "published" from "external_activity[publication_status]"
    And under "Sensors" I check "Force"
    And I press "Save"

    # Create an activity with no sensors:
    And I am on the new material page
    Then I should see "(new) /eresources"
    When I fill in "external_activity[name]" with "My No Sensor Activity"
    And I check "external_activity[is_official]"
    And I select "published" from "external_activity[publication_status]"
    And I press "Save"

    Given I am on the search instructional materials page
    And I uncheck "Sequence"
    And I check "Temperature"
    And I wait for the search to be ready
    Then I should see "My Temperature Sensor Activity"
    And I should not see "My Force Sensor Activity"
    And I should not see "My No Sensor Activity"

    When I check "Force"
    And I wait for the search to be ready
    Then I should see "My Temperature Sensor Activity"
    And I should see "My Force Sensor Activity"
    And I should not see "My No Sensor Activity"

    When I uncheck "Temperature"
    And I uncheck "Force"
    And I check "Sensors Not Necessary"
    And I wait for the search to be ready
    Then I should see "My No Sensor Activity"
