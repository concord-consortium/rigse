= RailRoad

RailRoad generates models and controllers diagrams in DOT language for a
Rails application.


= Usage

Run RailRoad on the Rails application's root directory. You can redirect its
output to a .dot file or pipe it to the dot or neato utilities to produce a
graphic. Model diagrams are intended to be processed using dot and
controller diagrams are best processed using neato.

      Produces a models diagram to the file 'models.dot'
    railroad -a -i -o full_models.dot -M
      Models diagram with all classes showing inheritance relations
    railroad -M | dot -Tsvg > models.svg
      Model diagram in SVG format
    railroad -C | neato -Tpng > controllers.png
      Controller diagram in PNG format
    railroad -h
      Shows usage help


= Processing DOT files

To produce a PNG image from model diagram generated by RailRoad you can
issue the following command:

    dot -Tpng models.dot > models.png

If you want to do the same with a controller diagram, use neato instead of
dot:

    neato -Tpng controllers.dot > controllers.png

If you want to produce SVG (vectorial, scalable, editable) files, you can do
the following:

    dot -Tsvg models.dot > models.svg
    neato -Tsvg controllers.dot > controllers.svg

Important: There is a bug in Graphviz tools when generating SVG files that
cause a text overflow. You can solve this problem editing (with a text
editor, not a graphical SVG editor) the file and replacing around line 12
"font-size:14.00;" by "font-size:11.00;", or by issuing the following command
(see "man sed"):

    sed -i 's/font-size:14.00/font-size:11.00/g' file.svg
    sed -i 's/font-size:14.00/font-size:11px/g' file.svg  # alternative

Note: For viewing and editing SVG there is an excellent opensource tool
called Inkscape (similar to Adobe Illustrator. For DOT processing you can
also use Omnigraffle (on Mac OS X).

= validation_reflection

If you have the
[validation_reflection](http://github.com/redinger/validation_reflection/tree/master)
plugin installed, your model ERD diagrams will properly distinguish
between required and optional associations.

Required associations are those that contain a
*validates_presence_of*, *validates_existence_of*,
*validates_associated*, or *validates_length_of* validation.

= RailRoad as a rake task

This version of railroad also works as a plugin.

    script/plugin install git://github.com/bryanlarsen/railroad.git
   
`rake doc:diagrams` produces 'doc/diagrams/models.svg',
'doc/diagrams/controllers.svg' and , 'doc/diagrams/states.svg'.

Update 'lib/railroad/tasks/diagrams.rake' to change the options for
your diagrams.
 
Running RailRoad as a rake task ensures that all of your plugins are
loaded correctly, and may work when railroad from the command line
fails.

These rake tasks are also available if you install railroad as a gem.
In that case, add to your top-level Rakefile:

    require 'railroad/tasks/diagrams'

= Requirements

RailRoad has been tested with Ruby 1.8.5 and Rails 1.1.6 to 1.2.3
applications. There is no additional requirements (nevertheless, all your
Rails application requirements must be installed).

In order to view/export the DOT diagrams, you'll need the processing tools
from Graphviz.
