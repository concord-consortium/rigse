# SimpleAccessControl
#
# Acknowledgements: I give all credit to Ezra and Technoweenie for their two plugins which
# inspired the interface design and a lot of the code for this one.
#
# SimpleAccessControl is a streamlined, intuitive authorisation system. It derives heavily from
# acl_system2 and has made clear some problems which plagued the author when first using it. Some
# fixes to acl_system2's design:
#
#       * a normal Rails syntax:
#             access_rule 'admin', :only => :index
#             access_rule '(moderator || admin)', :only => :new
#       * error handling for helper methods (permit? bombs out with current_visitor == nil)
#       * one-line parser, easy to replace or alter
#       * proper before_filter usage, meaning access rules are parsed only when needed
#       * no overrideable default (which I found counter-intuitive in the end)
# 
# Also, it has two methods, access_control and permit?, for those moving from acl_system2.
#
# But, let me stress, everyone likes a slightly different system, so this one may not be
# your style. I find it synchronises very well with the interface of Acts as Authenticated (even
# though I have modified it so much that it's now called Authenticated Cookie).
