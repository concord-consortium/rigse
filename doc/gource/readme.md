## Gource visualization of work on the application

Here's a 4 /12 minute [Gource](https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource) visualization of 2 1/2 years of commits (5777) to this codebase.

### [Jan 27, 2009 ... Sep 3, 2011](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFrLpHRRgv8)

What's happening in the visualization ...

- The connections between active directories are represented by splines, colored by the contents of the directories they connect to. When directories and files have not been modified for some time they slowly fade from view.
- Files are represented as colored spheres (the color generated by a hash of the file extension) which are laid out in a spiral pattern around the center of the directory the files belong to.
- Developers who are currently contributing to the project are floating near the files they are modifying.
- Developers illuminate the file they are modifying with colored beams: (green adding, orange modifying, red deleting).

Gource is a C++ OpenGL application that interactively renders a visualization showing how developers interact with source code in a repository over time.

### Installing Gource and ffmpeg on a Mac with [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/):

Install Gource:

    brew install gource

Install ffmpeg if you want to be able to generate movies from the Gource visualizations:

* basic ffmpeg install plus mpeg4 and webm codecs:

    brew install x264 libvpx ffmpeg  --with-tools

* complete ffmpeg install (if you want to use ffmpeg for all-around general transcoding and processing):

    brew install x264 libvpx faac theora libvorbis libogg libogg xvid ffmpeg

### Creating a Gource Visualization

Create a local cache of gravatar images of the developers in .git/avatar (http://code.google.com/p/gource/wiki/GravatarExample).

From the root directory of this application:

    $ perl doc/gource/get_gravatar_images.pl

To interactively play with a gource visualization (hiding the directories in vendor and public/javascript/):

    $ ./doc/gource/interactive.sh

See: http://github.com/acaudwell/Gource/blob/master/README for more information about these parameters and the commands available while the rendering is running.

Generating an mpeg4 video of the gource output (ffmpeg required):

    $ ./doc/gource/generate-mp4.sh

Generating an webm video of the gource output (ffmpeg required):

    $ ./doc/gource/generate-webm.sh
