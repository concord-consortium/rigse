Instead of making style sheets, make sass files.
Put them in public/stylesheets/sass/themes/<theme-name>/*.sass
They will be compiled and moved into public/stylesheets/themes/<theme-name>/*.css
Configure them in asset_packages.yml under the stylesheets section with the format:
- <themename>:
  - themes/<themename>/style_name
  - (others)
eg:

- itsisu
  - themes/itsisu/itsisu
  - accordion
