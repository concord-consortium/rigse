## Gource visualization of work on the application

[Gource](https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource) is a C++ OpenGL application that interactively renders a visualization showing how developers interact with source code in a repository over time.

Here's a 4 1/2 minute [Gource](https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource) visualization of 5777 commits (over 2 1/2 years) to this codebase.

What's happening in the visualization ...

- The connections between active directories are represented by splines, colored by the contents of the directories they connect to. 
- When directories and files have not been modified for some time they slowly fade from view.
- Files are represented as colored spheres (the color generated by a hash of the file extension) which are laid out in a spiral pattern around the center of the directory the files belong to.
- Developers who are currently contributing to the project are floating near the files they are modifying.
- Developers illuminate the file they are modifying with colored beams: (green adding, orange modifying, red deleting).

### Installing Gource on a Mac with [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/):

    brew install gource

### Install [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) if you want to be able to generate movies from the Gource visualizations:

*Basic ffmpeg install plus mpeg4 and webm codecs:*

    brew install x264 libvpx ffmpeg

*Complete ffmpeg install (if you want to use ffmpeg for all-around general transcoding and processing):*

    brew install x264 libvpx faac theora libvorbis libogg libogg xvid ffmpeg

### Creating a Gource Visualization

Create a local cache of gravatar images of the developers in .git/avatar http://code.google.com/p/gource/wiki/GravatarExample

From the root directory of this application:

    $ perl docs/gource/get_gravatar_images.pl

To interactively play with a gource visualization (hiding the directories in vendor and public/javascript/):

    $ ./docs/gource/interactive.sh

See: the [Gource readme](http://github.com/acaudwell/Gource/blob/master/README) for more information about these parameters and the commands available while the rendering is running.

Generating an mpeg4 video of the gource output (*ffmpeg required*):

    $ ./docs/gource/generate-mp4.sh

Generating an webm video of the gource output (*ffmpeg required*):

    $ ./docs/gource/generate-webm.sh
