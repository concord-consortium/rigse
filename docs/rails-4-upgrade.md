# Rails 4 Upgrade Steps

This documents the steps taken to upgrade Portal from ruby 2.2.6/rails 3.2.22 to the latest ruby/rails version along with any of the issues found along the way.  This should be a good resource for other project upgrades.

## Finding RJS use in the portal:
* Seach for occurance of: `render :update` and `page <<`
* Search log files for deprecation warnings: `DEPRECATION WARNING: Prototype Usage:`
* Review related efforts by hint:
  [github issues](https://github.com/concord-consortium/rigse/issues?page=2&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+prototype)
  [hint audit](https://github.com/concord-consortium/rigse/issues/457)

## Misc notes:
* remove teacher page (porta/teachers/##/show), but we need a way to set the teachers school

rspec ./spec/views/materials_collections/show.html.haml_spec.rb:19 # materials_collections/show renders attributes in accordion (with materials)

As part of this work, we should identify unused views (perhaps student registration?)


## Steps Todo:
* Rails 4 upgrade

## Steps Done:

* Upgrade Rails to 3.2.22.19
  * run `bundle update rails --patch` inside docker container to get to latest patch version
  * Test it on travis
* Upgrade Ruby version file to to 2.3.7
* Update Docker image (docker-rails-base-private)

## How to update the Base Docker image

Note: The Private Dockerhub repo named `docker-rails-base-private` Dockerfile is stored at
the Concord github repo named `docker-rails-base`

1. Check out the Concord Base image repo `git@github.com:concord-consortium/docker-rails-base.git`
2. Switch to the `ruby23` branch.
3. edit the Dockerfile
4. Build the docker image: `docker build . -t concordconsortium/docker-rails-base-private:<new-tag-here> --build-arg RAILS_LTS_PASS=<replace-with-password>`  `new-tag` is of the format `ruby-x.x.x-rails-x.x.x.xx` resulting in tag names like:
`concordconsortium/docker-rails-base-private:ruby-2.3.7-rails-3.2.22.19`
5. Push the build to dockerhub: `docker push concordconsortium/docker-rails-base-private:<new-tag-here>`
