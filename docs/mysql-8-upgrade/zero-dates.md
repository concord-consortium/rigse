# Zero Dates

The collection of queries below was generated by running:

```sql
`SELECT CONCAT('SELECT "', TABLE_NAME, '" AS table_name, "', COLUMN_NAME, '" AS column_name, COUNT(*) AS count FROM ', TABLE_SCHEMA, '.', TABLE_NAME, ' WHERE `', COLUMN_NAME, '` = "0000-00-00 00:00:00" UNION ALL ') FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'portal' AND DATA_TYPE IN ('date', 'datetime', 'timestamp');`
```

They can all be run at once to get a list of any zero date values that might exist in the database. When I ran this on the cloned database, there were no results. If you do get results, update the zero values to `NULL` or to a valid default date like `1970-01-01 00:00:01` if `NULL` is not allowed.

After updating any zero dates, run this query:
```sql
SELECT @@GLOBAL.sql_mode, @@SESSION.sql_mode;
```

If the result doesn't include `NO_ZERO_IN_DATE` and `NO_ZERO_DATE`, add them with this:
```sql
SET GLOBAL sql_mode = 'STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION';
```

## Just in case...

The steps below may be useful if the above doesn't work somehow.

1. Find columns that allow zero dates

```sql
SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME, COLUMN_TYPE, IS_NULLABLE, COLUMN_DEFAULT FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'portal' AND DATA_TYPE IN ('date', 'datetime', 'timestamp') AND COLUMN_DEFAULT = '0000-00-00 00:00:00';
```

2. Find tables containing zero dates

```sql
SELECT TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'portal' AND DATA_TYPE IN ('date', 'datetime', 'timestamp');
```

3. For each result, check for zero values

```sql
SELECT * FROM portal.users WHERE created_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00';
```

4. Try setting values to NULL

```sql
UPDATE portal.users SET created_at = NULL WHERE created_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00';
```

5. If NULL is not allowed, alter the column

```sql
ALTER TABLE portal.users MODIFY created_at DATETIME NULL DEFAULT NULL;
```

6. If step 5 is not allowed or successful, an alternative is setting a default valid date like `1970-01-01 00:00:01`

```sql
UPDATE portal.users SET created_at = '1970-01-01 00:00:01' WHERE created_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00';
```

7. Confirm all zero dates have been replaced

```sql
SELECT * FROM portal.users WHERE created_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00';
```
