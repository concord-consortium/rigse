  Scenario: Teacher reorders materials and students sees them in the correct order
    Given the following offerings exist
       | name                      |
       | Lumped circuit abstraction|
       | static discipline         |
       | Non Linear Devices        |
    And I am logged in with the username teacher
    And I am on the class edit page for "My Class"
    And I move investigation named "Non Linear Devices" to the top of the list
    And I press "Save"
    When I login with username: student
    And I follow "My Class"
    And I should see "Lumped circuit abstraction"
    And I should see "Non Linear Devices"
    And I should see "static discipline"
