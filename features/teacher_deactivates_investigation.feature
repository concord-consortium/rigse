Feature: Teacher can deactivate investigations from a class
  So my class can move on to other things
  As a teacher
  I want to unassign investigations from a class

  Background:
    Given The default project and jnlp resources exist using factories
    And the database has been seeded
    And the following simple investigations exist:
      | name                | user      | publication_status |
      | Test Investigation  | teacher   | published          |
    And the investigation "Test Investigation" is assigned to the class "My Class"
    And a student has performed work on the investigation "Test Investigation" for the class "My Class"
    And I am logged in with the username teacher

  Scenario: Teacher can see if student has performed work on an investigation
    When I am on the class page for "My Class"
    And I open the accordion for the offering for investigation "Test Investigation" for the class "My Class"
    Then I should see "1 student response"

    When I follow "deactivate" on the investigation "Test Investigation" from the class "My Class"
    And I am on the class page for "My Class"
    Then I should not see "0 student responses"
    And I should see "1 student response"

    When I follow "activate" on the investigation "Test Investigation" from the class "My Class"
    And I am on the class page for "My Class"
    Then I should not see "0 student responses"
    And I should see "1 student response"

  @dialog
  @javascript
  Scenario: Teacher drags active investigation with students off of class
    When I am on the class page for "My Class"
    And I drag the investigation "Test Investigation" in the class "My Class" to "#offering_list"
    And accept the dialog
    And I should wait 2 seconds
    And I should see "Test Investigation" within "#clazz_offerings"
    And the investigation "Test Investigation" in the class "My Class" should be active
