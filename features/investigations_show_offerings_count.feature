Feature: Investigations show the offerings count
  So I can see how many times an investigation has been assigned
  As a teacher
  I want to see the offerings count

  Background:
    Given The default project and jnlp resources exist using factories
    And the database has been seeded
    And the following classes exist:
      | name     | teacher |
      | My Class | teacher |
    Given I am logged in with the username teacher

  @javascript
  Scenario: The investigations list can show the offerings count
    Given the following empty investigations exist:
      | name       | user      | offerings_count | created_at                      | publication_status  |
      | NewestInv  | teacher   | 5               | Wed Jan 26 12:00:00 -0500 2011  | published           |

    When I show offerings count on the investigations page
    Then I should see "assigned 5 times"
    And I should see "assigned 10 times"
    And I should see "assigned 20 times"
