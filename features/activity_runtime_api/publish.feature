  Scenario: External REST activity is published the first time
    When the external runtime publishes the activity "Fun Stuff"
    Then the portal should respond with a "201" status and location
    And the portal should create an external activity with the following attributes:
      | name            | Cool Activity |

      | launch_url | http://activity.com/activity/1/sessions/ |
      | description     | This activity does fun stuff. |
    And the external activity should have a template
    And the portal should create an activity with the following attributes:
      | name            | Cool Activity |
    And the portal should create a section with the following attributes:
      | name            | Cool Activity Section 1 |
    And the portal should create a page with the following attributes:
      | name            | Cool Activity Page 1 |
    And the portal should create an open response with the following attributes:
      | prompt          | Do you like this activity? |
      | external_id     | 1234567 |

  Scenario: External REST activity is published the second time
    Given the external runtime published the activity "Fun Stuff" before
    When the external runtime publishes the activity "Fun Stuff" again
    Then magic stuff happens
