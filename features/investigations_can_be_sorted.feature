Feature: Investigations can be sorted
  So I can find an investigation more efficiently
  As a teacher
  I want to sort the investigations list
  
  Background:
    Given The default project and jnlp resources exist using factories
    And the database has been seeded
    And the following classes exist:
      | name      | teacher     |
      | My Class  | teacher     |
    And the following empty investigations exist:
      | name       | user      | offerings_count | created_at                      | publication_status  |
      | NewestInv  | teacher   | 5               | Wed Jan 26 12:00:00 -0500 2011  | published           |
      | MediumInv  | teacher   | 10              | Wed Jan 23 12:00:00 -0500 2011  | published           |
      | OldestInv  | teacher   | 20              | Wed Jan 20 12:00:00 -0500 2011  | published           |
    Given I am logged in with the username teacher
  
  Scenario: The investigation list page has a sort mechanism
    When I am on the investigations page
    Then the sort order selection should be "name ASC"

  @javascript
  Scenario: The investigations list can be sorted by name
    When I sort investigations by "name ASC"
    Then "MediumInv" should appear before "NewestInv"
    And "NewestInv" should appear before "OldestInv"

  @javascript
  Scenario: The investigations list can be sorted by date created
    When I sort investigations by "created_at DESC"
    Then "NewestInv" should appear before "MediumInv"
    And "MediumInv" should appear before "OldestInv"
    
  @javascript
  Scenario: The investigations list can be sorted by offerings count
    When I sort investigations by "offerings_count DESC"
    Then "OldestInv" should appear before "MediumInv"
    And "MediumInv" should appear before "NewestInv"
