Feature: Investigations can be reported on
  So that researchers can report on activies run by students
  As a researcher
  I want to print several kinds of reports
  So that our work can be validated
  Which will support the funding of future projects

  Background:
    Given The default project and jnlp resources exist using factories
    And the database has been seeded

    # for the sake of visual clarity, all correct answers are 'a'
    And the following multiple choice questions exists:
           | prompt | answers | correct_answer |
           | a      | a,b,c,d | a              |
           | b      | a,b,c,d | a              |
           | c      | a,b,c,d | a              |
           | d      | a,b,c,d | a              |
           | e      | a,b,c,d | a              |
           | f      | a,b,c,d | a              |
           | b_a    | a,b,c,d | a              |
           | b_b    | a,b,c,d | a              |
           | b_c    | a,b,c,d | a              |
           | b_d    | a,b,c,d | a              |
           | b_e    | a,b,c,d | a              |

    And there is an image question with the prompt "image_q"

    And the following investigations with multiple choices exist:
       | investigation        | activity | section   | page   | multiple_choices | image_questions |
       | first investigation  | act 1    | section 1 | page 1 | a, b             |                 |
       | first investigation  | act 2    | section 2 | page 2 | c, d             |                 |
       | second investigation | act 3    | section 3 | page 3 | b_a, b_b         | image_q         |
       | second investigation | act 4    | section 4 | page 4 | b_c, b_d         |                 |
