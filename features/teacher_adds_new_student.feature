  As a teacher
  I should be able to add a new student

    And I follow "Search for registered student."
    And I should see "Robert, Alfred"
    And I select "Robert, Alfred ( student )" from the html dropdown "student_id_selector"
    And I should see "Robert, Alfred"
    And I press "Add"
    Then I should see "Robert, Alfred" within the student list on the student roster page

    When I login with username: teacher password: password
    And I am on "Student Roster" page for "Mathematics"
    Then I should see "If a student already has an account, ask the student to enter the Class Word above"
    And I should not see "Search for registered student"
