    And the classes "Mathematics" are in a school named "Harvard School"
    And the classes "Biology" are in a school named "Harvard School"
    And the classes "Geography" are in a school named "Harvard School"
    And the following offerings exist in the classes:
      | name                      | class     |
      | Lumped circuit abstraction| Physics   |
      | static discipline         | Physics   |
      | Non Linear Devices        | Physics   |
    And the following students exist:
      | login     | password  |
      | student   | student   |
    And the student "student" belongs to class "Physics"
    And the student "student" belongs to class "Chemistry"
    And the student "student" belongs to class "Mathematics"
    And the student "student" belongs to class "Biology"
    And the student "student" belongs to class "Geography"
    And I am logged in with the username john
    And I go to the Manage Class Page
    
    
  @javascript
  Scenario: Teacher should be on Manage their Class Page
    Then I should be on Manage Class Page

    When I go to the Manage Class Page
    Then I should be on "my home page"
    
    
  @javascript
  Scenario: Teacher can reorder the class list
    When I move "Mathematics" to the top of the list with id "sortable"
    And the Manage class list state starts saving
    And the modal for saving manage classes dissappears
    Then "Mathematics" should be the first on the list with id "sortable"
    And "Mathematics" should be the first class within left panel for class navigation
    
    
  @javascript
  Scenario: Teacher deactivates classes
    When I uncheck "Biology"
    Then I should not see "Biology" within left panel for class navigation

    And I should not see "Geography" within left panel for class navigation
    
    
  @javascript
  Scenario: Student logs in and visits a class page which the teacher has deactivated
    When I uncheck "Biology"
    And I uncheck "Geography"
    And the Manage class list state starts saving
    And the modal for saving manage classes dissappears
    And I log out
    And I login with username: student
    Then I should see "Physics"

    And I fill in "Class Word:" with "etrx"
    And I fill in "Class Description" with "electronics class"
    And I press "Save" within the popup
    Then I should see "Copy of Physics"
    And "Copy of Physics" should be the last on the list with id "sortable"
    And "Copy of Physics" should be the last class within left panel for class navigation
    And there should be no student in "Copy of Physics"
    And I should see "Steve Ford"
    And I should see "John Nash"
    And I should see "Lumped circuit abstraction"
    And I should see "static discipline"
    And I should see "Non Linear Devices"
