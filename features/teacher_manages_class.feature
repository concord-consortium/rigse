Feature: Teacher manages a class
  
  As a teacher

  In order to make classes more effective
  
  Background:
    Given The default project and jnlp resources exist using factories
    And the database has been seeded
    And the following offerings exist in the classes:
      | name                      | class     |
      | Lumped circuit abstraction| Physics   |
      | static discipline         | Physics   |
      | Non Linear Devices        | Physics   |
    And I am logged in with the username teacher
    And I go to the Manage Class Page
    
    
  @javascript
  Scenario: Teacher creates a copy of a class
    When I follow copy class link for the class "Physics"
    And I fill in "Class Name:" with "Copy of Physics"
    And I fill in "Class Word:" with "etrx"
    And I fill in "Class Description" with "electronics class"
    And I press "Save" within the popup
    Then I should see "Copy of Physics"
    And "Copy of Physics" should be the last on the list with id "sortable"
    And "Copy of Physics" should be the last class within left panel for class navigation
    And there should be no student in "Copy of Physics"
    And I should see "Robert Fernandez"
    And I should see "John Nash"
    And I should see "Lumped circuit abstraction"
    And I should see "static discipline"
    And I should see "Non Linear Devices"
