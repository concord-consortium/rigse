Feature: Investigation index pages can be printed
  So I can take investigation data with me
  As a teacher
  I want to print the investigation index page

  Background:
    Given The default project and jnlp resources exist using factories
    And the database has been seeded
    And I am logged in with the username teacher
    And the following empty investigations exist:
      | name       | user      | offerings_count | created_at                      | publication_status  |
      | NewestInv  | teacher   | 5               | Wed Jan 26 12:00:00 -0500 2011  | published           |
      | MediumInv  | teacher   | 10              | Wed Jan 23 12:00:00 -0500 2011  | published           |
      | OldestInv  | teacher   | 20              | Wed Jan 20 12:00:00 -0500 2011  | published           |

  Scenario: Teacher prints the listing of all investigations with usage counts
    When I am on the investigations page
    Then I should see "NewestInv"
    And I should see "MediumInv"
    And I should see "OldestInv"
    And I should see "printable view"
    And "printable-view" should have href like "printable_index"
    And the link to "printable-view" should have a target "_blank"
    When show usage count is enabled on the session
    And I am on the investigations printable index page
    Then I should see "Investigation"
    And I should see "Usage Count"
    And I should see "NewestInv"
    And I should see "MediumInv"
    And I should see "OldestInv"
