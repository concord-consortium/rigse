Feature: Investigations can be searched
  So I can find an investigation more efficiently
  As a teacher
  I want to sort the investigations list

  Background:
    Given The default project and jnlp resources exist using factories
    And the database has been seeded
    And the following empty investigations exist:
        | name                    | user   | offerings_count | publication_status |
        | g Investigation         | author | 5               | published          |

  @javascript 
  Scenario: Default display of public investigations is name ASC
    When I browse public investigations
    Then There should be 20 investigations displayed
    And  "copy" should not be displayed in the investigations list
    And  "a Investigation" should appear before "b Investigation"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Changing the sort order
    When I sort investigations by "name DESC"
    Then There should be 20 investigations displayed
    And  "copy" should not be displayed in the investigations list
    And  "z Investigation" should appear before "y Investigation"   

  @javascript
  Scenario: Searching public investigations
    When I sort investigations by "name ASC"
    And I click on the next page of results
    Then There should be 20 investigations displayed
    And "copy" should not be displayed in the investigations list
    And I follow "Next â†’"
    And I should see "y Investigation"
    And I should see "z Investigation"
    And "y Investigation" should appear before "z Investigation"

  @javascript
  Scenario:  browsing unpublished investigations
    When I browse draft investigations
    And I click on the next page of results
    Then There should be 20 investigations displayed
    And "copy" should be displayed in the investigations list

  @javascript
  Scenario: searching unpublished investigations
    When I browse draft investigations
    And I enter "copy of" in the search box
    And I wait for all pending requests to complete
    Then every investigation should contain "copy of"
