# This is a docker-compose overlay that uses unison for syncing files between the host
# and containers.  On OS X it is much faster than simple mounting of local files

# A convient way to overlay this file is to add a `.env` file with the contents:
#  COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker/dev/docker-compose-sync.yml
# if you are making changes to docker-compose.yml or this file it is useful to
# run `docker-compose config` which shows how the two files get merged together
