# Publish the capybara port. This makes it possible to run chrome driver on the host

# To use this you must edit your .env file and change `COMPOSE_FILE` var
# to include `docker/dev/docker-compose-no-logstash.yml`

# Note about defined port:
# When running features in non-headless mode the app communicates with chromedriver on
#  the host machine (at port 9515). Then, on the host machine, Chrome needs to make a
# connection back into the Docker container at the port that the test server is running on.
# In this case we've chosen port 43447. This port is not used elsewhere so should not
# have any port conflicts.
