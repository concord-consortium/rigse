# This is a docker-compose overlay that connects the portal to LARA via a
# proxy container. It assumes the proxy container name is "http-proxy"
# - If you are running dinghy on Mac OS, this is the name the dinghy proxy
#   will have if you followed its documentation here:
#   https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy-http-proxy#os-x
#
# - If you are running dory on linux, you will need to change the default
#   name of the http proxy container. To do that you will need to tell
#   dory to generate a config file. Do that with
#       `dory config-file`
#   This will write the config file ~/.dory.yml
#   Change the following config file line in the "nginx_proxy" section from:
#       container_name: dory_dinghy_http_proxy
#   to:
#       container_name: http-proxy
#
# LARA host is assumed to be app.lara.docker. If not, you can set LARA_HOST in your environment (e.g. .env file).
services:
  app:
    environment:
      # import local LARA_HOST env variable
      LARA_HOST:
    external_links:
      # use app.lara.docker as the default value
      - http-proxy:${LARA_HOST:-app.lara.docker}
